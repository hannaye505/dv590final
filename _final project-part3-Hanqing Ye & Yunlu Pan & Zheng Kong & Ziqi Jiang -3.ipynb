    "## Brief Introduction about the original dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's the name of the dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Provider Summary for the Top 100 Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) - FY2016\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) was introduced by the federal government in October, 1983, as a way to change hospital behavior through financial incentives that encourage more cost-efficient management of medical care. Under IPPS, hospitals are paid a pre-determined rate for each Medicare admission. Each patient is classified into a diagnostic category (MS-DRG) on the basis of clinical information. Except for certain patients with exceptionally high costs (called outliers), the hospital is paid a flat rate for the MS-DRG, regardless of the actual services provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data provided here include hospital-specific charges for the more than 3,000 U.S. hospitals that receive Medicare Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) payments for the top 100 most frequently billed discharges for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hospitals determine what they will charge for items and services provided to patients and these charges are the amount the hospital bills for an item or service. The Total Payment amount includes the MS-DRG amount, bill total per diem, beneficiary primary payer claim payment amount, beneficiary Part A coinsurance amount, beneficiary deductible amount, beneficiary blood deducible amount and DRG outlier amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these DRGs, average charges, average total payments, and average Medicare payments are calculated at the individual hospital level. We will visualize the nationwide discharges, payments and charges in various statistical approaches.\n",

    "### Data process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. After looking into the dataset, and there are no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For the information to be visualized, we picked up the following variables :\n",
    "\n",
    "        1) 'DRG Definition',\n",
    "        \n",
    "        2) 'Provider State',\n",
    "        \n",
    "        3) 'Total Discharges'\n",
    "        \n",
    "        4) 'Average Covered Charges'\n",
    "        \n",
    "        5) 'Average Total Payments',\n",
    "        \n",
    "        6) 'Average Medicare Payments'\n",
    "        \n",
    "3. We grouped these records according to their 'Provider State's and 'DRG Definition's and replace the NaNs with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The mean, median, maximum, minimum, size(number of records), sum are calculated by group.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Our exploration and attempts on visualization reveals the necessity of normalizing. So, we shortened the gap on the statistics among states by not using the statistics of \"sum\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We use the package of 'plotly' to both generate geographic choropleth map of the United States and bulid up the interactive functions which empower users explore specific statistic of the chosen value for the DRG they select. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Judging from the visualization and our common sense, we are fairly confident that not all hospitals in the United States submitted their records on payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There are chances that not all discharges, charges or payments were recorded by these hospitals."
